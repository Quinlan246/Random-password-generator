# <Random-password-generator>

## This weeks objective was to build a random password generator

- It required the option for lowercase and uppercase letters. As well as numbers and special characters.

- I added in a variable for the option to add each one of those based off the users selection.

- After those four selections, the option for password length would generate.

- After all the options were anwsered the password would generate in the window based off the users selections.
